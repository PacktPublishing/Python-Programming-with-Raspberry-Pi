# Python Programming with Raspberry Pi
This is the code repository for [Python Programming with Raspberry Pi](https://www.packtpub.com/hardware-and-creative/python-programming-raspberry-pi-zero?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_content=9781786467577), published by Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

## About the Book
Raspberry Pi Zero is a super-small and super-affordable product from Raspberry Pi that is packed with a plethora of features and has grabbed the notice of programmers, especially those who use Python.

This step-by-step guide will get you developing practical applications in Python using a Raspberry Pi Zero. It will become a valuable resource as you learn the essential details of interfacing sensors and actuators to a Raspberry Pi, as well as acquiring and displaying data.

You will get started by writing a Python program that blinks an LED at 1-second intervals. Then you will learn to write simple logic to execute tasks based upon sensor data (for example, to control a motor) and retrieve data from the web (such as to check e-mails to provide a visual alert). Finally, you will learn to build a home automation system with Python where different appliances are controlled using the Raspberry Pi.

The examples discussed in each chapter of this book culminate in a project that help improve the quality of people’s lives.

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter5


The code will look like the following:

       
         static int ngpios;
       
         static int gpios[2] = { -1 , -1 };
       
         module_param_array(gpios, int, &ngpios, S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IWGRP);
       
       
         MODULE_PARM_DESC(gpios, "Defines the GPIOs number to be used as a list of"
       
                          " numbers separated by commas.");

         /* Logging stuff */
       
         #define __message(level, fmt, args...)                                  \
       
                         printk(level "%s: " fmt "\n" , NAME , ## args)
